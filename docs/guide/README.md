## Introduction

Vue Swatches is a Vue Component that allows to choose colors.

Unlike classic color pickers, where all colors are available (167 77 216 colors), Vue Swatches only shows a bunch of predefined colors.

## Browser Compatibility

This component has the same support than Vue itself. However if you want to use this with IE9, you will probably need to work on the CSS styles. IE10 should be fine
